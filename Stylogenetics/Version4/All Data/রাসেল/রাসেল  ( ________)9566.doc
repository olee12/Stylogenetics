                        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Inevitable Realities During The Revelation of Shibir  As no historic incident takes place without a backdrop, such no organization generates without demands. The establishment of Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir was an inevitable demand of the time. The entire socio-economical, religious, political and cultural milieu of Bangladesh intensified the need of the establishment of Shibir.A. Post-independent Bangladesh The war of independence in Bangladesh ended on December 16, 1971. The people - longing for freedom, won victory after a nine month long homicidal war. But regrettably enough, even with the achievement of a free country, a geographical boundary, a national flag - we failed to win true independence.India, the neighbouring country who lend a helping hand during the liberation war, immediately started asserting dominance over us. Our precious resources trespassed through the border.   M. a. Zalil,   one of the sector commanders during the war, became the first political prisoner as he took a stand against these issues. Within a very short period, economical disaster, instability in politics and vacancy in culture occupied the country. The freedom of the nation soon transformed into subjugation due to the utter anarchy. Renowned researcher Abul Mansur Ahmed referred to the condition as - "To purchase something at a higher rate and to sell that at a lower price - is indeed our freedom". "আবুল মনসুর আহমেদ" -বেশী দামে কেনা কম  দামে বেচা আমাদের স্বাধীনতা- তিনি বাংলাদেশী মুসলিম জাতীয়তাবাদের প্রবক্তা- যৌবন গিয়েছে ইশ্বর ভজনায় যার, একটা ধর্মভিত্তিক রাষ্ট্রের সব রকম সুযোগ সুবিধাই তাকে কিঞ্চিৎ ইসলামমনস্ক করে রেখেছিলো, এবং যৌবনে বেড়ে উঠবার কালেই তার সাথেই বড় হয়েছে প্রাক্তন ভারত কিংবা পূর্ব বাংলা কিংবা পূর্ব পাকিস্তানের সাম্প্রদায়িকতা। যখন মানুষগুলো আর মানুষ থাকলো না, তাদের ধুতি আর লুঙ্গি, তাদের দাড়ি আর কামানো গাল, তাদের পানি আর জল আলাদা হয়ে গেলো, সবাই মানুষ থেকে ক্রমগত পশু হতে হতে মুসলিম আর হিন্দু হয়ে গেলো, সে সময়েই যৌবনে, রাজনীতি সংশ্লিষ্ট থাকবার কারণেই তার কাফিরবিদ্বেষ ছিলো, ভারত এবং তার পশ্চিম বাংলা থেকে আলাদা কিছু একটা সত্ত্বাগত প্রয়োজনে তার মুসলিম জাতীয়তাবাদের আমদানি স্বাধীন বাংলাদেশে। এবং এটাই ছাত্র শিবির কয়েন করেছে, কারণ তাদের নিজস্ব মেধায় কিছুই আসে না।During the years '71 to '75, the sheer autocratic government - 'BAKSHAAL', was founded in the democratic Bangladesh. All the parties, along with their principles and ideas, were seized by the throat. Formation of any other parties or organizations in the name of Islam was prohibited. এটা ঘটেছিলো ১৯৭১এর বিভীষিকার প্রতিক্রিয়ায়, বাংলাদেশের প্রথম গৃহীত সংবিধানে ধর্ম ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি নিষিদ্ধ ঘোষিত হয়েছিলো, সেটা ইসলাম নয় স্পষ্টই ধর্ম ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি হিসেবেই ছিলো, সংশোধনী আছে সংবিধানের সেখানেই এসব লিখিত।বাকশালের বাস্তবতা ১৯৭৪ এর পরবর্তী সময়ে, All the newspapers, excluding the four which were published under the governance of the authority, were banned. Men fell in a stretched comer of the dark law. They lost the freedom of speech and individuality. Thirty thousand young lives were sacrificed as a punishment of their protest. The nation sunk into the abyss of a malicious and perverted party who held the slogan of 'Single leader, single nation'. These licentious young men, with their hands chained, vexed the life of the people by taking shelter behind the shield of administration, which was in reality an utter misrule. Even the right to mourn at one's distress was snatched away by the lawless condition. A million people died from famine, the Bashantis prevented themselves from embarrassment by covering the body with tom nets, human and hounds struggled together for the scraps of food in the dustbin. The heirs of the men in power went beyond the law. The innocent people fall a victim to the dark law.B. The dream of Sonar Bangla: The want of Golden people Bangladesh is a dreamland abounding with many rivers and fruitful trees and com. There was a time when 8 mon (1 mon = 37.38 kg) rice i.e. almost 320 kg rice cost only one taka. There were rich granaries filled up with rice, sheds full of cows and houses overflowing and nourished with love and tenderness. That is why this Bangla was entitled as 'Sonar Bangla' (Bengal of Gold). Continuous attempts were made to snatch away the contentment, prosperity and solidity of this nation with colonial control and invasions of the Marhattas (borgee). Whoever gave hope to the nation, they promised to establish the 'Sonar Bangla'. During the liberation war against the dictatorial government of Pakistan, the same assurance was made to give hope to one and all and thus the people were inspired to fall over in the warfare. But who made the utter disappointment about that expectation? The government himself stated, "Men dig up a gold mine but I've dug out a mine of thieves. There are thieves all around me. In average, a number of seven and a half crore blankets have arrived for seven and a half crore of people, but where's my one?"It is never so easy to establish a 'Sonar BangIa' as it is easy to dream of it. A league of golden human beings is required for the purpose. A group of truthful, honest, proficient and patriot people is needed who will be precious than the gold itself. How can it be possible to make our dreams come true without these people?Human beings are developed chiefly by the edification procedure. As it is necessary to sow the seed for the harvest, in the same way it is essential to launch a suitable edification procedure to acquire golden people.Evidently or non-evidently, we have been observing the same educational system for two hundred years and more that the English introduced. Following this procedure, we can never form an accomplished man truthful and patriot, with fear of Allah in his heart.When the condition of Bangladesh reached such consequence, there appeared the significant change of scene during the year 1975. The leader of the liberation war, the president of the country - who was at the same time the originator of absolute autocratic ruling system, was killed along with his entire family. But alas! No people were found mourning for the tragic incident. On the contrary, his own companions and fellow men took over the power. A number of events took place within a short span of time. The country arrived at an unusual state after getting through military governance and emergence of Democracy. It was difficult for the disappointed and distressed people to comprehend what the destiny of the nation was. At this point of state, some pondering and courageous youngsters - depending on the almighty Allah, make a decision to institute an ideal student organization with a view to build up the young society. On February 6, 1977 Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir, the desired institute of the peace-loving young generation, started its expedition from the central jam-e-masjid of Dhaka University, the Oxford of the east. The reverberated oath of sweet tone was composed We have encamped at the bank of Padma, Meghna, Jamuna We have chosen the path of the Holy Prophet holding the bayonet of pledge. সব চেয়ে চমৎকার ভাষণ এটাই, তাদের অপেক্ষা করতে হয়েছি জিয়ার সংবিধান সংশোধন করা পর্যন্ত এবং তাদের পেছনের রাজনৈতিক বাস্তবতা তখন ভিন্ন। তবে ইসলামী ছাত্র শিবিরের জন্ম কথা চমৎকার।-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Shibir has already been performing the act against smoking for the last 30 years, which the Bangladeshi government has passed in the year 2000.
