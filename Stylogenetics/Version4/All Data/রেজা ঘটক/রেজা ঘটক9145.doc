MUST READ TEXT BEFORE PICTURE This photo was taken in a hospital after the patient in the bed was in an accident where he was responsible for a young woman's death. It is said that when you receive this image and do not send it to at least five people, the woman will look for you during the night to collect your soul. A couple in a western suburbs area of Sydney received the message and deleted the picture without sending it to at least five people. This couple was murdered by their 15 year old neighbour who claims to have been possessed by the woman. A 28 year old woman in Whittlesea Road, Cambridgeshire, England, was run down by a car driven by another female that fit the description of the woman in the photograph, the police investigation revealed that the murdered lady had received this picture only 4 hours before her untimely death and did not pass it on to at least 5 people.
