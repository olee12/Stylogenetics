লালনের চারটি গানের ইংরেজি অনুবাদ





 বাড়ির কাছে আরশী নগর ....
             I have not seen her1 even once--
            my neighbor
            who lives in the city of mirrors
            near my house.
             Her village is surrounded
            by deep boundless waters,
            and I have no boat
            to cross over.
            I long to see her,
            but how can I reach
            her village?
             What can I say
            about my neighbor?
            She has no hands, no feet,
            no shoulders, no head.
            Sometimes she floats high up in the sky,
            sometimes in the water.
             If my neighbor only touched me,
            she would send the pain of death away.
            She and Lalon are in the same place,
            yet five hundred thousand miles apart.

 খাঁচার ভিতর অচিন পাখি কেমনে আসে যায় ...
 A Strange Bird
 Look, how a strange bird flits in and out of the cage!
O brother, I wish I could bind it with my mindís fetters.
Have you seen a house of eight rooms with nine doors
Closed and open, with windows in between, mirrored?
O mind, you are a bird encaged! And of green sticks
Is your cage made, but it will be broken one day.
Lalon says: Open the cage, look how the bird wings away!

 সব লোকে কয় লালন কি জাত সংসারে ...
 Casteism
 People ask, what is Lalon's caste?
Lalon says, my eyes fail to detect
The signs of caste. Don't you see that
Some wear garlands, some rosaries
Around the neck? But does it make any
Difference brother? O, tell me,
What mark does one carry when
One is born, or when one dies?
A muslim is marked by the sign
Of circumcision; but how should
You mark a woman? If a Brahmin male
Is known by the thread he wears,
How is a woman known? People of the world,
O brother, talk of marks and signs,
But Lalon says: I have only dissolved
The raft of signs, the marks of caste
In the deluge of the One!

       Everyone wonders, "What's Lalon faith?"
        Lalon says, "I've never ' seen' the face
        of Faith with these eyes of mine!"
         Circumcision marks a Muslim man,
        what then marks a Muslim woman?
        A Brahmin I recognize by the Holy thread;
        how do I recognize a Brahmin-woman?
         Everyone wonders, "What's Lalon faith?"
         Some wear a garland and some the tasbi,
        that's what marks the Faiths apart.
        But what marks them apart when
        one is born or at the time of death?
         Everyone wonders, "What's Lalon faith?"
         The whole world talks about Faith,
        everyone displaying their pride!
        Lalon says, "My Faith has capsized
        in this Market of Desire...."
         Everyone wonders, "What's Lalon faith?"
