হায়, দুঃখিনী চন্দ্রাবতী!




 
                        জয়চন্দ্রের আত্মহত্যার পর বাকিটা জীবন এভাবেই কেটেছিল কবি চন্দ্রাবতীর ।
মহিলা কবি বলাটা কি এ যুগে সঙ্গত হবে? তা হলে মহিলা কবি নাই বললাম। তবে বলে রাখি যে চন্দ্রাবতীই নারীদের মধ্যে বাংলাসাহিত্যে প্রথম উল্লেখযোগ্য কবি। তাঁর হাতে অতি সহজেই ভাষা ও ছন্দ ধরা দিলেও তাঁর জীবনে ছিল গভীর বিরহ। আমৃত্যু তাঁর কেটেছিল সর্বনাশা এক বিয়োগান্তক স্মৃতি নিয়ে।
 চন্দ্রাবতীর জন্ম ১৫৫০ খ্রিস্টাব্দে তৎকালীন বাংলার বৃহত্তর ময়মনসিংহের পাটবাড়ি গাঁয়ে; বাবা ছিলেন বিখ্যাত কবি-দ্বিজ বংশীদাস। মেয়েবেলায় কিশোরী চন্দ্রা ভালোবেসেছিল গ্রামেরই এক কিশোর জয়চন্দ্রকে। পরে জয়চন্দ্র কমলা নামে এক মুসলিম তরুণীর সঙ্গে কী এক সর্বনাশা মুহূর্তে প্রনয়ে জড়িয়ে পড়েছিল।পরে অবশ্য ঘোর কেটে গেলে চন্দ্রাবতীর কাছে ফিরেও এসেছিল জয়চন্দ্র। না। চন্দ্রাবতী গ্রহন করেনি জয়চন্দ্রকে। 
পাটবাড়ি গাঁয়ের পাশেই কূলকূল করে বইছিল ফুলেশ্বরী নদী। 
জয়চন্দ্র রাগে দুঃখে হতাশায় ক্ষোভে সে নদীতে ঝাঁপিয়ে পড়ে আত্মহত্যা করল!
 না। চন্দ্রাবতী আর বিবাহ করেননি। বরং আমৃত্যু বসেছিলেন ফুলেশ্বরী নদীর ঘাটে। কন্যার অভিপ্রায় বুঝতে পেরে চন্দ্রাবতীর বাবা কবি দ্বিজ বংশীদাস একটি শিবমন্দির গড়ে দিয়েছিলেন ফুলেশ্বরী নদীর পাড়ে। সেই মন্দিরের ঘাটেই আমৃত্যু বসেছিলেন চন্দ্রাবতী। মধ্যরাত্রির জ্যোস্নায় ...
আমৃত্যু কাব্যসাধনা করেছেন কবি। 
তারই কিছু নমুনা।
 1. Dear Alien
 Do women not carry water
From where you come?
Are river banks not allowed
To the female sex!
Do men bring in the drinking water, carry the vessels?
Have your forefathers always scolded you for
Looking at a woman?
Is it unbearable the thought of a woman touching water,
water that gives life… all too precious
to be trusted in the hands of women…
by the way where is it that you come from?
Over here women go to the river everyday,
And no ones stares the
The way you did today!
  2. Divinest Chandraboti
 I do not know
What women carry or do not carry
at home or in other parts of the world.
I cannot have lived at all
Not having seen, before yesterday, you Chandraboti.
Oh, was there a river too??!
Where I come from
Women are sweet, docile, tulsi-tending, husband-worshipping
Son-giving, everything a man could ask for
And did I still stare at Chandraboti?
I did IF she made me
Stare
Or breathe
Or live
Or die.
Yours, Joydev
 3. Dear Joydev
 How thoughtful of you
To leave your letter
Among the flowers I had collected
For my father, the Acharya’s pooja!
Had I not had a wasp to displace settled among
that bed of white jui and crimson hibiscus
how would I have known that
an alien whom I may now call Joydev
not only stares
but also snoops
on women unawares!?
You must try harder Joydev.
I read a little and
Do not easily
Swoon
at sweet nothings
Specially those
From men
Who know what artifice to use
To make menials of fawning women.
 Truly, Chandra.
  4. Chandra
 Chandra fawn for me! So that I can make a menial out of Chandra?
Why mock me, Chandra?
I gathered that you read voraciously.
My artifices are simple
Naïve, a lot more down to earth
Than yours that you collect from your books
As a bee gluts itself on the honey it takes.
Tell me honestly,
Without artifices that make virgins virtuous…
Have you not felt as I
Unabashedly declare I did?
Did not your blood rush
to touch my letter,
I, the Snooper, did not imagine you turning crimson
I saw you, wet and trembling, standing among the morning dew
in a white saree, your hair like Meghdoot’s clouds.
I could have given my life to cling to the moment I laid my eyes on you,
Loving you, I did no wrong
If your dawn rituals are done out of obsequiousness to a God one cannot see
My rituals to follow Chandra, to worship her flesh and soul
should not appear unseemly!
Truly, Deeply, Madly Yours, Joy.
 5. Sutra
 I have professed I read a little
I have not, however, come across any Virgin’s Manual for Fooling Men!!
I do not know how to deceive whatever artifices I may possess,
I know of a simple sutra though
Written by a bachelor (?) sage.
The sutra proclaims that
Joy is ephemeral
And suffering real
What Joy gives easily (no puns here on your name)
Is taken away summarily on a whimsy.
Suffering is the more faithful love
Who sits, sighs, woos you to the end.
I trembled this dawn, Joydev, as I was cold,
Turned crimson because I felt caught
In fetters that I did not think existed for Chandraboti.
Yes, I am flesh and blood and everything in between that
Makes us weak and unwise!
You did not do anything wrong to love me because
No sanyasi’s sutra clouds your mind.
I on the other hand have been warned
And I know I am out of my mind
To tell Joy that I love him back.
-Bewildered, Chandra
   6. Bewildered
 I trembled too, Chandra, because I was hot
And not just with desire
But because I felt a bewildering sort of peace.
I pledge myself a slave to Chandra,
in dreams,
in waking moments and in slumber.
I will hold you, hold me forever too, Chandra
Mock me some more, tell me I am raving.
But banish sutras, my Chandra, that bewilder you
Be my wife, my mate, my soul!
Enraptured, Chandra’s Joy
 7. Riverbank
 Why do I tremble so, she is ravishing, I am hot
with desire
with a bewildering weakness, She’s exquisite, perfect!
I will hold you, woman without a name
Mock me, tell me I am raving, unfaithful
Remind me that I have pledged myself to Chandra.
 No, banish such thoughts, this Moslem beauty that bewilders me
Shall be my wife, my mate, my soul!
   8. The Bride-to-be
 Oh this red is too red for me
And oh dear! must I wear those too
The filigree gold chains and anklets?
Pardon me, I can dress myself.
I know Joy wouldn’t care if his
Bride came in ashes or in alta We will pay homage to the sacred fire together
And I’ll wear my vermillion and shanka
Only for Joy, my husband, my equal, my other self.
 9. How’s that !
 “She is extremely stupid, if I may say so
Imagine reading all those books, such a father’s daughter
Being so stupid!”
“Did you see her shed her gold chains and forget that her aanchal trailed?”
“And wipe all those alpanas we made with her dragging feet
Silly girl, to think men can be constant!”
“But Joydev marrying a Muslim
forsaking our ancestral Gods,
Isn’t that so over the top?”
“I knew this would happen, told her just as much!”
“Did you now, how come?”
“Strange you should need to ask.
Doesn’t falling in love tell you something
does it not have an ominous ring?”
“Oh, Oh, poor Chandraboti ,
what will she do, who will have her now?”
“Silly girl, to think men can be constant!”
 10. Lost in Translation
 Chandra, hate me
As I deserve
But I must tell you
Of my grief
I don’t know how it was
I married someone I did not love
And forsook, left my Chandra, shindoor-less
Waiting for me in her bridal wear.
Like in a foreign tongue,
Something incomprehensible
Was jibber-jabbering in my head
My heart, I wish…Chandra
You had left me my heart as an amulet!
My well-read Chandra,
Read in my unabashed anguish,
I love you more than myself
Translate my monstrous regret
As my sincerest protestations of love.
Sweet Chandra, hate me as I deserve
But have me back!
Jalal/Joy
 11. Statue
 This is not you
Chandra
The Gods have substituted
My Chandra with a blankness
stone for flesh
And stillness for breath
Ah! Chandra I know you love me still
But are blind to your Joy, to his fate, to his life!
I am raving, it wasn’t you, it was I who was blind,
Blind in love for Chandra, blind in my errant ways,
blinded now by your glistening reserve.
Tell me, Chandra, tell me you are human
Like the rest of us, that blemishless
Though you are, you understand
Frailty and Weakness, and Corruption
Not only as discourse,
but also as human passions
We are not statues or Gods
Chandra, speak to me one more time
And I will be gone,
Forever, leaving you
My unwed wife!
in your barren temple.
 12. Temple Door
 How quiet it grows all of a sudden!
How peaceful
How monstrous looks the dawn
Red, vermillion, gold!
Or may be it’s just my reddened eyes that makes it look so vile
Old temple threshold, hold me, protect me
Ancients guide me
What poor comfort my books are now
And you Gods that stare and stare
Chandra’s tears are too human to mean anything to you my Gods!
Well, here’s a new dawn
A fresh deluge of torture
Forget, remember, forget, and with ferocity remember
I had Joy and lost Joy and could have had him again!
No, he left me, left his Gods,
He wanted me, he repented his errant ways
No, he left me, left his Gods.
He wanted…Enough,
Women go to the river here every day
I can do it again.
How quiet it grows all of a sudden!
And how sharp the air is today
How cold the water’s touch
I tremble, Joydev, are you here? Bloated with peace at last?
Why, Joydev, the river? you always hated water!
