Soul mate





                        (Both the husband and the wife are equally responsible for maintaining the love and warmth in their relationship.)Marriage is a life time relationship for every couple.Every couple wishes to lead a happy and peaceful life.The responsibility of such a relationship depends on both the alleys of marriage- the husband and the wife.Faith is the basic requirement for the success of a married kife which binds both of them in the thread of love.They should not hide even the slightest of doubts or misunderstandingd in their mind.This is very important aspect of the reletionship as both of them should respeat the feelings of each other.If both of them maintain this aspect of the relationship,i have no doubt in the success in your relationship.sex is undoubtedly an unavoidable reqirement of the reletionship and it is very true that the success of your realtionship largely depends upon your sexual life.Try to manage everything skillfully even if you find them wrong.Develop a friendly yet respectful relationship with them so that they can also get the confidence in you and your attitude towards them.This is very important to make your spouse that you really care each other's feelings.Never show passiveness in your attitude towards your life partner.That will help you to build a good and healthy rapport between you two.A young couple gets married,and the groom asks his bride if he can have a dresser drawer of his own that she will never open.The bride agrees.After 30 years of marrige,she notices that his drawer has been left open.She peeks inside and sees 3 golf balls and $1,000.She confronts her husband and asks for an explanation.He explains "Every time i was unfaithful to you,i put a golf ball in the drawer."She figures 3 times in 30 years isn't bad asks "But what about the $ 1,000?" He replied "When- ever i got a dozen golf balls,i sold them"("Beauty is that Which attracts your soul, and that which loves to give and not to receive.")At the end,i would like share a quote from one of my favourite poets -Robert Frost:"The Woods are lobely,dark,ad deep,But i have promises to keep,And miles to go before i sleepAnd miles to go before i sleep."
