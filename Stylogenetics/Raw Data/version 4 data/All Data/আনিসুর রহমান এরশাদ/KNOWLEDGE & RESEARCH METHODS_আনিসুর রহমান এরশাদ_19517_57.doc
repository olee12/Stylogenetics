KNOWLEDGE & RESEARCH METHODS





                         ‘Capacity of learning’ is important for learner. Capacity of learning’ means, Knowledge about what to learn, Skill about how to learn, Attitude about Why / for whom to learn. There are two things of learning I know what I know & I know what I don’t know. We must know that- Knowledge is increased through discussion, Skill increased through practice, Attitude is developed through extrinsic & intrinsic motivation. Capacity of Interpretation depends on Knowledge. Knowledge means Experience about what to be interpreted . Interpreter will have-Wisdom, Sense of priority, place, Sense of time, context & content, Skill about How to be Interpreted, Attitude about to whom & why to be interpreted. They will have - Writing skill, Speaking skill, Practicing, Visualizing with due sense of art. For our intellectual activities have some important Methodology. Review of the existing Literature & Thoughts. Rethinking those thoughts with Reference to Context , , Time & Space. Need assessment of the Ummah according the Challenges of The Modern Era. Execution in Accordance with the Findings of the Research & Dissemination of the Research Findings amongst the whole Ummah & World. If you want to change the society by your merit & intellectual activities. You Will ensure that-Acquisition of a minimum level of knowledge in a particular area. Dissemination of the acquired knowledge & ideas among the University students. Recruiting of regular participants as Intellectual leaders in future. Research is a systemic investigation, using the principles of the scientific method, to test hypotheses, Acquire information and solve problems pertaining to human interrelationships. Types of Research are Practical Research & Theoretical Research. Nature of Research are Qualitative & Quantitative. Intentions of research are Pre-experimental & Experimental. Research Use in Basic, Applied & Action. If you want to positive change in society you must realize social values, norms, social problem possibility. For this reason Social research is very most important. Social research refers to research conducted by social scientists. Social research methods may be divided into two broad categories: 1) Quantitative designs attempt to reduce social phenomena to quantifiable data which can then be statistically analyzed, focusing on the links and attributes across several cases. 2) Qualitative designs emphasize personal experiences, interpretation, and self-knowledge over quantification, are concerned with understanding the meaning of social phenomena, and focus on links and attributes across relatively few cases. When your knowledge level reach very high then you will be a perfect person for Basic research. Basic research or fundamental research (sometimes pure research) is research carried out to increase understanding of fundamental principles. Many times the end results have no direct or immediate commercial benefits: basic research can be thought of as arising out of curiosity. Basic research is the source of most new scientific ideas and ways of thinking about the world. Do you know about Original research? Original research is research that is not exclusively based on a summary, review or synthesis of earlier publications on the subject of research. This material is of a primary source character. The purpose of the original research is to produce new knowledge, rather than to present the existing knowledge in a new form. Now action research or participatory action research is popular in social research field. Action research or participatory action research is a recognized form of experimental research that focuses on the effects of the researcher's direct actions of practice within a participatory community with the goal of improving the performance quality of the community or an area of concern. We hope that, many youth researcher can make a good environment in Research and Development field. The phrase research and development, according to the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development, refers to "creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications". Research is need for every sector . it is important for business, banking, politics, cultures e.t.c. For example Market research & Marketing research. Without it any business institution can not sustained & expanse day by day. Market research is any organized effort to gather information about markets or customers. It is a very important component of business strategy. Marketing research is the systematic gathering, recording, and analysis of data about issues relating to marketing products and services. marketing research Or, alternatively, by methodological approach:1)Qualitative marketing research, and 2) Quantitative marketing research. The goal of marketing research is to identify and assess how changing elements of the marketing mix impacts customer behavior. Now i would like to explain about Qualitative Social Research & some important concept of Research. The qualitative method investigates the why and how of decision making, not just what, where, when. Qualitative methods produce information only on the particular cases studied, and any more general conclusions are only hypotheses (informative guesses). Narrative Research is a study of stories or narrative or descriptions of a series of events that accounts for human experiences. Phenomenology is a study that describes the meaning of experiences of a phenomenon ( or topics/concepts)for several individuals; central meaning or the essence of the experience. Grounded theory: A final outcome of the imperative study process that is reached when the insights are grounded on observations & the conclusions seem to be firm. Ethnography is the systematic study of human cultures and the similarities and dissimilarities between them. Case Study is in-depth studies in which data are gathered & analyzed about an individual unit if analysis based on diverse on diverse array of date collection materials.  Now i want to say Quantitative Social Research. It has four types. Descriptive ( Content analysis), Quantitative descriptive ( Survey), Experimental, Quasi-experimental. Purpose of this research is - Exploration, Scale/Instrument development, Variable relationships, Evaluation Quantitative research refers to the systematic empirical investigation of quantitative properties and phenomena and their relationships. The objective of quantitative research is to develop and employ mathematical models, theories and/or hypotheses pertaining to phenomena.  May be It’s clear that Qualitative methods produce information only on the particular cases studied, and any more general conclusions are only hypotheses. Quantitative methods can be used to verify, which of such hypotheses are true. Necessity of Social Research are Purpose, Policy,Plan, Program, Project, Information . General Steps of Social Research are Selection of Research Topic / Problem, Review of Literature ( Document analysis), Preparation of Research Proposal / Research Design, Data Collection Instrument Preparation, Recruitment & Training of Field Workers, Instrument Pre- Testing & Modification, Sample selection, Data collection, Data Processing , Analysis & Presentation, Report Preparation, Publication, Presentation and Distribution of the Report. If you want to fund from any donor agency for any research. You must have to knowledge about Research Proposal .Items of a Research Proposal are Title, Introduction (Problem statement , Utility of study, Justification of the study,Manageability of the study),Objectives of the Study, Assumption / Hypothesis ,Definition of the concepts, Methodology ( Method, Study Area / Population, Sample and Sampling ,Techniques and instruments of Data Collection, Data Processing, Analysis and Presentation, Design / Format of Study ReportBudget, Time schedule. Sources of Information are People & Document. Types of data/ information / Variable are Qualitative and/or Quantitative, Continuous and/or Discrete, Experimental, Control and/ or Extraneous. Data Collection Techniques & Tools are-Techniques ToolsObservation..................Gide-lineInterview.......................ScheduleQuestionnaire...............QuestionnaireDiscussion....................MultipleDocument .....................Check-list* PRA, RRA,PLA etc. Parts & Items of a Reports are Firstly Introductory part: 1)Cover Page a.
