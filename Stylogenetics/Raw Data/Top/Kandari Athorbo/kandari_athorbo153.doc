আগুনের আয়োজনঃ একটি ছবি ব্লগ

                   You're far away, so far away 
Have to believe that you can still feel me 
And I can only wait and miss you 
Now we're locked in time, out on the wire 
I wish that I could fight the world for you 
I'm always on your side 
If I could trade places, you know I would 
 Hold on 
Don't let go 
Just stay on that road in that heartbeat 
You're not alone in the dark, can you see me 
 Cos I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you 
I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you 
I'm there in the light when you need me, to find your way home 
 I'll never leave, you know I won't 
I feel you're close, you're coming back to me 
And summer may be over 
But she leaves you her song 
 Hold on 
Don't let go 
Just stay on that road in that heartbeat 
You're not alone in the dark, can you see me 
 Cos I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you 
I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you 
I'm there in the light when you need me, to find your way home 
 I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you 
I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you 
I'll be lighting fires 
 Oh whoa 
 Just stay on that road in that heartbeat 
You're not alone in the dark, can you see me 
 Cos I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you 
I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you 
 I'm there in the light when you need me, to find your way home    Ronan Keating - Fires Lyrics
