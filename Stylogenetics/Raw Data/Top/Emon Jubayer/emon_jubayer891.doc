রাগের নাম: যোগ

           Jog is a North Indian Raga belonging to Kafi Thaat. It is one of the more popular ragas appearing often in films.
  Structure
 Raga Jog omits both the second interval, Re, and the sixth interval, Dha, making it pentatonic, or Audav in nature. In ascending, it uses Theevra Ga, and in descending, it uses both Theevra, and Komal Ga. It takes Raga Tilang for its base which itself is derived from Khamaj. The key idea here is the insertion of the Komal Gandhar in Tilang's flow through a vakra avarohi prayoga.  The Arohana is: Sa Ga Ma Pa Ni' Sa
 The Avarohana is: Sa Ni' Pa Ma Ga' Ga Sa
