Fragile
Fragile - Poets Of The FallYou've been biting bullets all these years, I know
There beside yourself, choking back tears
And you aced avoiding possibility
When you made your bed upon the bittersweet
Oh now don't you worry
There's no need to be sorry
There's still time to step lightly
Cos the love you used to feel is still in there, inside
It may be the faded photograph, the lock of hair, don't hide
If you're scared, I'm here to hold you,
If you get lost I'm here to guide you
Love is peace when peace is fragile
Love is all the good in you that still remains
Love is peace when peace is fragile
You've been going out of way to agree
Like you've been rubbing yourself all wrong just to be somebody else's genie
Catering to your disasters every need
Waiting to finally be set free
I said baby don't worry
Life will carry
Just take it slowly...
Illusion & Dream
Illusion And Dream - Poets Of The FallLook in my eyes I'll make you see
We're drifting aimlessly
Blind in a world of make believe
Hear them sing their songs off key
N' nod like they agree
Buying the need to be discreet
I've got no hand in matters worldly, I hardly care at all
What's going on fails to concern me, Cos I'm locked behind my wall
But you know what drives me out
Out of my mind
It's whatever makes you see, makes you believe
And forget about the premonition you need to conceive
That the images they sell are illusion & dream
In other words dishonesty
If I speak Ill, please, humor me
Won't rant on endlessly
Just thought I'd try to make you see
It doesn't solve a thing to dress it in a pretty gown
A stone will not need you to guess if
You're still going to drown
So you know what drives me out
Out of my mind
It's whatever makes you see, makes you believe
And forget about the premonition you need to conceive
That the images they sell are illusion & dream
In other words dishonesty
So can you name your demon?
Understand its scheming
I raise my glass and say "here's to you"
Can you chase your demon?
Or will it take your freedom?
I raise my class and say "here's to you"
Shallow
Shallow - Poets of the FallMore in my face
Than is my taste
I grow so weary I'll surrender
To what they say
Let them lead the way
Till' I can no longer remember
My darling dreams
Prewritten scenes
Whatever felt my own
So to save face
I'll take my place
Where I may safely feel alone
Glad the waters are so shallow
When the river runs so cold
I'm quick to wait
Too slow to take
They call me gracious for my patience
And I feel proud
Under that shroud
And all the while it's all evasion
Some humor here
To fend off fear
And I'm a little more lost, oh dear
So to save face
I'll hold my place
So I may safely feel alone...
Maybe Tomorrow is a Better Day
Maybe Tomorrow is a Better Day - Poets of the FallI'd stay the hand of god, but the war is on your lips
How can I brace myself for razor blades on whips
When everything with meaning is shattered, broken, screaming
And I'm lost inside this darkness and I fear I won't survive
I could pray and trick with a double tongue, but the only fool here's me
I choose the way to go, but the road won't set me free
Cos I wish you'd see me, baby, save me, I'm going crazy
Tryin' to keep us real, keep us alive
This day will die tonight and there ain't no exception
We shouldn't wait for nothing to wait for
Love me in this fable, babe, my heart is in your hand
Our time is waiting right outside your door
And maybe tomorrow is a better day
I do not deal the cards and I play a lousy hand
I celebrate no victories and my promises are sand
Against all this I contrast you, when all is lost the war is through
Hey angel, dare the winds now we can fly
This day will die tonight and there ain't no exception
Why should I wait for nothing to wait for
Let me love you in this fable, hold your heart in my hand
Our time is waiting right outside your door
And maybe tomorrow is a better day
This day will die tonight and there ain't no exception
Why should I wait for nothing to wait for
I won't cry for my solitude, lay my head and dream of you
And hope that you'll come knocking on my door
And maybe tomorrow is a better day
I know tomorrow is a better day
Carnival of Rust
Carnival of Rust - Poets of the FallD' you breath the name of your saviour in your hour of need,
n' taste the blame if the flavor should remind you of greed,
Of implication, insinuation and ill will, till' you cannot lie still,
In all this turmoil, before red cape and foil come closing in for a kill
Come feed the rain
Cos I'm thirsty for your love dancing underneath the skies of lust
Yeah feed the rain
Cos without your love my life ain't nothing but this carnival of rust
It's all a game, avoiding failure, when true colors will bleed
All in the name of misbehavior and the things we don't need
I lust for after no disaster can touch us anymore
And more than ever, I hope to never fall, where enough is not the same it was before
Don't walk away, don't walk away, oh, when the world is burning
Don't walk away, don't walk away, oh, when the heart is yearning
