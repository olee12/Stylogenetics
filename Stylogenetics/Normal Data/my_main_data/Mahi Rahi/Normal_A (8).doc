লন্ডনে নতুন জন্ম নেয়া শিশুর সবচাইতে জনপ্রিয় নাম এখন মুহাম্মদ




                        প্রথমবারের মত মুহাম্মদ লন্ডনে নতুন জন্ম নেয়া শিশুর সবচাইতে জনপ্রিয় নাম পরিনত হয়েছে । সারা ইংল্যান্ডজুড়ে ৭ হাজার ৩২জন শিশুর নাম ছিল Muhammad  ( 18th )  ,  Mohammed  ( 25th )  and Mohammad  ( 58th )  বানানে । http :  /  / www . bbc . co . uk / news / uk - 23663337 Mohammad has become the most popular name for baby boys in London for the first time . Combined spellings of the Islamic prophet ’ s name have made it the most popular name for newborn boys in England for three years in a row . They rank higher than other favourites such as Harry and Jack in the top 100 names for boys from the Office for National Statistics . Now ,  however ,  the single variant Muhammad has topped the list in the capital with 768 registered births last year ,  ahead of Daniel on 666 . When combined with Mohammed ,  the name was more than double any other with 1479 boys given the name . Across England ,  a total of 7 , 032 babies were given the name using the spellings of Muhammad  ( 18th )  ,  Mohammed  ( 25th )  and Mohammad  ( 58th )   –  topping the 6 , 893 that were called Harry . On the top 100 names for boys and girls ,  there has been a surge in names probably more often seen in an Edwardian novel . While Harry and Amelia were the most popular baby names in 2012 for the second year running ,  names such as Hugo ,  Sonny and Seth for boys ,  and Ivy ,  Darcey ,  Tilly and Violet for girls are storming up the list . Meanwhile several modern names which had gained popularity in recent years  –  including Ashton and Reece for boys and Nicole and Kayla for girls  –  have dropped out of the top 100 altogether . Lisa Penney ,  of the parenting club Bounty . com ,  believes that while celebrity - styled or unusual names may be fun ,  parents know their children will  ‘ probably have an easier ride in the playground if they choose a more traditional name ’  . She said :   ‘ We are now seeing a growing trend for  “ old man ”  and  “ old lady ”  names .  ‘ Just a few years ago Ava and Isla were relatively unheard of as a baby girl ’ s name ,  yet now they are in the top 20 .  ’ Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said :   ‘ Many mums are looking back into their family tree and selecting great - grandparents ’  names ,  while others are seeking names which would have seemed stuffy a decade ago but fit with the current retro vibe across the UK .  ’ It has been suggested that television shows such as Strictly Come Dancing ,  which counts former ballerina Darcey Bussell as one of its judges ,  could be responsible for boosting the popularity of the name Darcey . Since 1999 the number of babies called Mohammed ,  however spelled ,  has increased by more than half .
