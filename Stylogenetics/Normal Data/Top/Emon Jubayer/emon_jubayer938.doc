সুমেরিয় সভ্যতা

  সুমেরি সভ্যতাই বিশ্বের প্রথম নগরসভ্যতা।   সুমেরিয় সভ্যতা বিকাশ লাভ করেছিল প্রাচীন মেসোপটেমিয়ায়। বর্তমান দক্ষিণ ইরাক। সময়কাল ৫৩০০ খ্রিস্টপূর্ব।    সুমের নগর।   জিগুরাট । প্রার্থনা গৃহ।                 By the late 4th millennium BC, Sumer was divided into about a dozen independent city-states, whose limits were defined by canals and boundary stones. Each was centered on a temple dedicated to the particular patron god or goddess of the city and ruled over by a priestly governor (ensi) or by a king (lugal) who was intimately tied to the city's religious rites.          We don't know that this was the 1st civilization. Continued archeological digs suggest that there may be more civilizations yet to be discovered (especially in Africa). However, what makes it the 1st civilation has to do with how the term "civilization" is defined. There were many peoples scattered throughout the globe for centuries; however, Sumer, as a civilization, contained the necessary elements to qualify as an actual civilization (a complex society characterized by the process of state formation, the practice of agriculture and settlement in cities) and thus received this designation.
