ধর্মপদ থেকে পাঠ: Hard it is to be born, Hard it is to live, Do what is right. Be pure.

 বুদ্ধ বলেছিলেন: জীবন দুঃখময়। দুঃখকে এড়াতে হলে সচেতন থাকতে হবে। তা হলে দুঃখ আর তাকে ছুঁতে পারবে না। তখন তার চোখ মুক্ত, তখন তার পা স্বাধীন; তখন আর তার পক্ষে পথ ভুল করা সম্ভব না;আর তাকে আকাঙ্খার বিশাক্ত জাল ঘিরতে পারবে না। কেননা, সে তো জাগ্রত। ঈশ্বর তাকে দেখছেন। সে ধ্যানের শান্তমৌনতায় পায় সুখ। আত্মসমরপনের শান্তি সে পেয়েছে। বুদ্ধ বলেছেন- Hard it is to be born,Hard it is to live,Harder still to hear of the way,And hard to rise, follow, and awake.Yet the reaching is simple.Do what is right.Be pure. মানবজীবন বড় কঠিনবেঁচে থাকাও বড় কঠিনসুপথ খোঁজা আরও কঠিনজেগে ওঠাও ভীষন কঠিন।লক্ষ্যে যদিও  পৌঁছনো সহজ-নির্মল হয়ে ভালো কাজ করে।   ধর্মপদ থেকে পাঠ-14. The Man Who Is Awake He is awake.The victory is his.He has conquered the world.How can he lose the wayWho is beyond the way?His eye is openHis foot is free.Who can follow after him?The world cannot reclaim himOr lead him astray,Nor can the poisoned net of desire hold him.He is awake!The gods watch over him.He is awakeAnd finds joy in the stillness of meditationAnd in the sweetness of surrender.Hard it is to be born,Hard it is to live,Harder still to hear of the way,And hard to rise, follow, and awake.Yet the reaching is simple.Do what is right.Be pure.At the end of the way is freedom.Till then, patience.If you wound or grieve another,You have not learned detachment.Offend in neither word nor deed.Eat with moderation.Live in your heart.Seek the highest consciousness.Master yourself according to the dharma.This is the simple teaching of the awakened.The rain could turn to goldAnd still your thirst would not be slaked.Desire is unquenchableOr it ends in tears, even in heaven.He who wishes to awakeConsumes his desiresJoyfully.In his fear a man may shelterIn mountains or in forests,In groves of sacred trees or in shrines.But how can he hide there from his sorrow?He who shelters in the wayAnd travels with those who follow itComes to see the four great truths.Concerning sorrow,The beginning of sorrow,The eightfold wayAnd the end of sorrow.Then at last he is safe.He has shaken off sorrow.He is free.The awakened are few and hard to find.Happy is the house where a man awakes.Blessed is his birth.Blessed is the teaching of the way.Blessed is the understanding among those who follow it,And blessed is their determination.And blessed are those who revereThe man who awakes and follows the way.They are free from fear.They are free.They have crossed over the river of sorrow.অনুবাদ: টমাস বাইরোম।
