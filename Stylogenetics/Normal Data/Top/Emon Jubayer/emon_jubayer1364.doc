মন নিয়ে বুদ্ধ যা বলেছিলেন।


 
                        বুদ্ধ। মানবজাতির শিক্ষকদের অন্যতম। তাঁর উপদেশগুলি লিপিবদ্ধ করে রাখা হয়েছে 'ধর্মপদ'-এ। ধর্মপদের তৃতীয় অধ্যায়ে মানুষের মন নিয়ে বুদ্ধ যে সব উপদেশ দিয়েছিলেন সেসবই আজ তুলে ধরলাম।   Dhammapada 3. Mind As the fletcher whittlesAnd makes straight his arrows,So the master directsHis straying thoughts.Like a fish out of water,Stranded on the shore,Thoughts thrash and quiver,For how can they shake off desire?They tremble, they are unsteady,They wander at their own will.It is good to control them,And to master them brings happiness.But how subtle they are,How elusive!The task is to quieten them,And by ruling them to find happiness.With single-mindednessThe master quells his thoughts.He ends their wandering.Seated in the cave of the heart,He finds freedom.How can a troubled mindUnderstand the way?If a man is disturbedHe will never be filled with knowledge.An untroubled mind,No longer seeking to considerWhat is right and what is wrong,A mind beyond judgements,Watches and understands.Know that the body is a fragile jar,And make a castle of your mind.In every trialLet understanding fight for youTo defend what you have won.For soon the body is discarded,Then what does it feel?A useless log of wood, it lies on the ground,Then what does it know?Your worst enemy cannot harm youAs much as your own thoughts, unguarded.But once mastered,No one can help you as much,Not even your father or your mother.  অনুবাদ করেছেন থমাস বাইরম।
